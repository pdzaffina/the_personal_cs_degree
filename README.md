# The Personal CS Degree
An opinionated and curated list of Computer Science concepts in the spirit of Josh Kaufman's *The Personal MBA* (https://personalmba.com/)

## Intro
My name is Peter Zaffina and I'm passionate about using technology to improve people's lives. I'm a self taught technologist with a focus on designing systems to help small local government businesses solve their workflow problems. 

I'm living proof of the character Will Hunting's quote:
> You wasted $150,000 on an education you coulda got for $1.50 in late fees at the public library.
>
> â€• Matt Damon, Good Will Hunting 

I've compiled a list of references to help guide others with their self development journey.

## Opinions
- Zen of Python
- Web is platform that best delivers write once, run anywhere
- LoB apps in Enterprise as web first
- Event driven to act as unifying sysytem of lots of different disparate systems
  - Customer addresses and every system needing access to a central data system. When One changes some other businesses need the knowledge that there was a change, even if they don't want to change.
